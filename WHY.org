#+TITLE: Open Source Library Analytics For Great Good
#+AUTHOR: Avi Press

The software community as a whole is becoming increasingly more dependent on the
work relatively small collection of open source software (OSS) developers. This
wonderful group of people who give their free time to write that software is
increasingly [[https://blog.usejournal.com/some-difficulties-with-open source-software-c377af831a6a][burning out]] doing work that everyone benefits from. Companies of
all sizes, whether directly or indirectly, are profiting from the value they get
out of this OSS. The developers themselves, however, rarely get anything in
return for the value they are providing to these companies. This should change,
but the question of how has remained unclear.

I've spoken with many OSS developers and users about their opinions on this
topic. The general outlook is bleak. Everyone sees the issues, and no one sees a
good solution. It's a hard problem! Most of the developers producing widely used
software still don't have access to a generally approachable and successful
business model. For users, there's very little incentive to donate one's
hard-earned money for something that doesn't /cost/ money.

What makes things even harder for these developers is, as Andrew Nesbitt puts it
in this excellent [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW4wUpoBHr8][talk]]:

Maintainers are working mostly in the dark

This is an important point. Package maintainers have little insight into how
their packages are used, which makes their job difficult. The maintainers
typically don't know which platforms their users are on, which packages are used
together with theirs (and with which versions), what errors might be happening,
or which features of their packages are actually getting used. Github issues
alone are a noisy and still incomplete picture to the actual user base. Some of
the most popular OSS projects learn about their users through an annual survey.
It's notable if not ironic that the group who's life's work essentially boils
down to automation still prefers manual data collection in this way.

As Nesbitt points out, this is a largely solved problem in other software
domains, especially the web. Tools like Google Analytics have made it simple and
easy to understand who is coming to your website and how they use it. The analog
for open source packages varies by the community but is generally still much less
developed. Some package managers like Homebrew actually do collect installation
statistics, as do npm and others. Unfortunately, the data they collect is
still limited, and whether the data is even exposed to package maintainers
directly varies between package managers.

So what can we, the software development community do about this?

One thing we could all do would be to convince our employers to support the
awesome people that build and maintain the OSS they rely on. But you knew that
already. One free thing we can do is:

/Build, use, and tolerate OSS that reports usage data back to the maintainers./
Not everyone can financially support OSS, but anyone can report usage
statistics. This would help maintainers be better informed about their software.
In a world where it is not uncommon for a 3rd party library to break your code
in a patch release, having well-informed maintainers benefits everyone. It will
help you deliver better software, and it will improve all the other software you
use.

Today, Scarf is rolling out a [[https://github.com/scarf-sh/scarf-js][new library]] to help with this exact problem,
targeting the node ecosystem.


*For Maintainers*

As a package author, simply adding a dependency on Scarf will kick off data
reporting anytime your package is installed, giving you key insights that can
help make your life just a little bit easier.

- Which packages are commonly used along with yours?
- Some insight into your users:
  - Usage trends (/Is my package gaining popularity or losing it?/)
  - Operating systems (/Did the newest release break Windows?/)
  - Country (/What language should I consider translating the README to?/)
  - Company (/Which companies might be interested in supporting my work?/)

The library itself has zero dependencies, transparently logs everything it's
doing, and logs on a best-effort basis so it will never interrupt the user. If
you configure Scarf to be opt-out by default, you won't risk collecting data
from anyone who didn't explicitly give you the OK.

*For Users*

If you are a user of a package that's using Scarf, you can feel good about
knowing that you are doing your part to support the amazing people who build the
OSS you rely on. Now there's a concrete way to support OSS developers without
paying money!

Concerned about privacy? While Scarf keeps data as safe as possible with up to
date best-practices, it is certainly understandable that reporting data is not
appropriate in all situations. You might be against it altogether. That's ok!
Whether the package authors choose to use Scarf with users opted in or out by
default, you can enable or disable Scarf analytics easily. Your data will not
leave your computer, and you can still be happy that the software you use can be
more effectively maintained.

I hope that by giving open source developers standardized tools for safe
data collection and analytics, we will have a community of better informed, less
burnt out maintainers. A general movement in this direction would help both
makers and users of open source! Whether or not you yourself are willing to
report data, being supportive of developers simply /asking/ for usage data can
help the situation. No matter what your relationship with open source software
is, there's something you can do to make things better for everyone!
